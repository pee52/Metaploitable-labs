## Lab 07 – Post-Exploitation & Lateral Movement

Target Information
Target: Metasploitable 2
Operating System: Linux
Initial Access Level: Root (obtained from Lab 05 / persisted in Lab 06)
Attack Type: Post-Exploitation / Lateral Movement
Severity: Critical

## Objective
The objective of this lab was to identify and abuse post-exploitation opportunities that allow an attacker to expand access beyond the initially compromised host.
This includes harvesting credentials, enumerating network trust relationships, and assessing the feasibility of lateral movement to other systems within the same network.

## Initial Context
After establishing persistent root access in Lab 06, the attacker had full administrative control of the compromised host.
At this stage, the attack focus shifted from maintaining access to leveraging the compromised system as a foothold for further attacks within the internal network.

## Enumeration
Post-exploitation enumeration was conducted to identify lateral movement opportunities, including:
-Network configuration and connected interfaces
-Active network connections and routing tables
-Stored credentials and configuration files
-User home directories and shell history
-Services communicating with external or internal systems
-Trust relationships (SSH keys, reused credentials, shared services)
The goal was to determine whether the compromised host could be used to access additional systems.

## Vulnerabilities Identified
Weak Internal Trust & Credential Exposure
Several weaknesses were identified that could facilitate lateral movement:
-Presence of reusable or plaintext credentials within configuration files
-Insecure service configurations communicating with other hosts
-Lack of internal network segmentation
-Absence of monitoring for internal reconnaissance activities
Vulnerability Type:
Post-Exploitation Weakness / Lateral Movement Opportunity

Exploitation (Lateral Movement)
Using root-level access, the attacker was able to:
-Harvest sensitive system and service information
-Enumerate internal network assets reachable from the compromised host
-Assess authentication mechanisms for potential reuse of credentials
-Validate the compromised system’s ability to act as a pivot point
While no additional hosts were fully compromised during this lab, the assessment confirmed that the environment lacked sufficient internal security controls to prevent lateral movement.

## Proof of Exploitation
The following evidence confirms successful post-exploitation and lateral movement assessment:
-Screenshots showing internal network enumeration from the compromised host
-Terminal output demonstrating access to network configuration and trust data
-Verification of sustained root-level control during lateral movement attempts
Verification Output:

whoami
root

This confirms that all post-exploitation and lateral movement activities were performed with full administrative privileges.

## Result
-Post-exploitation enumeration was successful
-The compromised host was validated as a viable pivot point
-Internal security weaknesses enabling lateral movement were identified
Final Access Level: Root (UID 0)

## Impact
If lateral movement were fully exploited, an attacker could:
-Compromise additional systems within the internal network
-Escalate the attack from a single host to an entire environment
-Access sensitive data across multiple systems
-Establish multi-host persistence and command-and-control infrastructure
Impact Level: Critical

## Mitigation & Recommendations
To prevent lateral movement attacks, the following measures are recommended:
-Implement strong internal network segmentation
-Enforce unique credentials per system and service
-Disable unnecessary trust relationships between hosts
-Monitor internal network traffic for anomalous behavior
-Apply least-privilege principles to services and users
-Deploy centralized logging and intrusion detection

## Lessons Learned
A single compromised host can act as a powerful entry point into an internal network.
Without proper segmentation and monitoring, attackers can move laterally with minimal resistance, even without exploiting additional vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion
This lab demonstrated that post-exploitation is not limited to a single system.
Once root access is obtained and persistence is established, attackers can leverage weak internal controls to expand their reach across the network.
Effective defense requires not only patching vulnerabilities, but also enforcing internal security controls, continuous monitoring, and strong segmentation to limit attacker movement after compromise.
